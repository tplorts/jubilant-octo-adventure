1. In a sorted number array and two integers, ‘K’ and ‘X’ find ‘K’ closest numbers to ‘X’ in the array. Return the numbers in the sorted order. ‘X’ is not necessarily there in the array.
1. Given an array of integers and a value, determine if there are any two integers in the array whose sum is equal to the given value. If the sum exists, return true; otherwise, return false.
1. If you’re given the head of a linked list and a key, how do you delete the node that contains this given key?
1. Determine whether or not an input string produces a valid number. Assume that there are no white spaces in the input for the sake of simplicity.
1. If you’re given a dictionary of words and a large input string, How can you tell if an input string can be completely segmented into words from a given dictionary?
1. Find all non-single letter substrings of a string that are palindromes.
1. In an input string, determine if it makes a valid number or not. For simplicity, assume that white spaces are not present in the input. 4.325 is a valid number; 1.1.1 is NOT a valid number.
1. Given an array of integer nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
1. Swap the 'left' and 'right' children for each node, given the root node of a binary tree.
1. Determine whether a string's letters can be rearranged so that no two identical characters appear next to each other.
